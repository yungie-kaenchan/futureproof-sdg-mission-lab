    body: `
Khon Kaen province draws its drinking water from two sources. The first is surface water, mainly the Ubolratana Reservoir on the Nam Phong River. The second is groundwater, pumped from a network of deep wells that tap the Khorat Plateau <vocab>aquifer</vocab> below the city.

In recent years, surface water has become less reliable. The reservoir reached zero usable capacity during three separate dry seasons within the last decade. Each time, the Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) leaned more heavily on the wellfield to keep household taps running.

The <vocab>aquifer</vocab> below the plateau is not endless. Reports from the Department of Groundwater Resources describe accelerating <vocab>drawdown</vocab> — water tables are dropping faster than the rainy season can refill them. In some districts, shallow wells that families have used for generations now run dry by March.

The province has approved a plan to add 12 new deep wells this dry season. The plan is legal under the Groundwater Act B.E. 2520. Whether it is wise is a different question — and that question depends on whose interests you weigh first.

    heading: "Part 2 — Who depends on the aquifer",
    body: `
Around 200,000 residents in Khon Kaen city rely on PWA-supplied tap water. PWA's statutory <vocab>mandate</vocab> is to keep that supply continuous. If taps run dry for even a few days, the public health and political costs are severe.

Outside the city, smallholder farmers across the Nam Phong basin depend on shallow private wells. These wells were drilled cheaply — most reach only 30 to 60 metres. They tap the upper <vocab>aquifer</vocab> layer that recharges from rainfall each monsoon. When the city's deeper municipal wells draw heavily, the upper layer drops too, and family wells run dry weeks earlier than they used to.

Industrial users — including food-processing facilities and beverage manufacturers — hold permits issued under separate regulations. Some facilities in the basin pump from layers 200 metres or deeper. Their permits were granted years ago, when the <vocab>aquifer</vocab> was considered abundant.

Community Health Volunteers (อสม.) in rural districts report a pattern: when household wells fail, families switch to surface ponds or unfiltered river water. Diarrhoea cases in young children rise within two weeks. The link is not catastrophic, but it is consistent.

    heading: "Part 3 — Why the aquifer cannot just be refilled",
    body: `
The Khorat Plateau <vocab>aquifer</vocab> recharges slowly. Rainfall must percolate through layers of soil and rock, a process measured in years and decades, not weeks. The plateau also contains zones of natural rock salt. When the <vocab>aquifer</vocab> is drawn down too far, brine from these deeper layers can move upward and contaminate freshwater supplies — a process called saline <vocab>intrusion</vocab>.

Researchers at Khon Kaen University and at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) have warned that <vocab>allocation</vocab> decisions made today will lock in water-quality outcomes for the next generation. Once an <vocab>aquifer</vocab> turns saline, reversing the damage takes decades, if it can be done at all.

    heading: "Part 4 — The decision before you",
    body: `
The province has the legal <vocab>mandate</vocab> to drill the new wells. The PWA has the operational need. The <vocab>aquifer</vocab> has a <vocab>threshold</vocab> beyond which damage is no longer reversible. Different stakeholders disagree about whether that <vocab>threshold</vocab> has already been crossed.

Your team has been asked to brief the provincial council before the wellfield expansion is finalized. The council will not accept "it depends." It needs a position — and reasoning that holds up when other stakeholders push back.
